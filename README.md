# RecipeApp
I am the type who would lose my recipes in my sea of notes on Google Notes. Hence, I created this recipe app so I can keep them like a book even till i'm 80.

Create a react template before transferring the files from the frontend folder to the react template folders.
Download the package.json which will give you the npm packages that you need to start the recipe webapp.
